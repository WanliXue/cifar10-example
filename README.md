# CIFAR-10 Examples using TensorFlow

### IPython notebook with TensorFlow's tutorial and a more basic model (no image augmentation yet) to help understand what is happening in the model.

The notebook has a script adapted from tensorflows tutorial in CIFAR (see link below).

The python file is a different script altogether which is much easier to go though.

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.
