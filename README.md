#CIFAR-10 Examples with TensorFlow

### IPython notebook with TensorFlow's tutorial and a modified example to evaluate other images.

cifar10.py contains the mojority of the program, cifar10_train.py downloads the image training and test sets and begins training. cifar10_eval.py prints the accuracy of the trained model on the test/evaluation image set.

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

Code in this directory demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) on both CPU and GPU. We also demonstrate how to train a CNN over multiple GPUs.
